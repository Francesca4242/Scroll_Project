# Scroll Visualiser

A tool that loads webp images, or high quality tiff images and displays them next to each other. Mapping the original images of the scroll to the unwrapped equivalents with new x,y,z co-ordinates which are displayed on both sides.


-This tool supports lazy loading and cache-ing which means that it doesn't use as much ram, considering the large amount of data there is to analyse.
-It supports lower resolution webp images as well as the high resolution originals.
-This tool maps the scroll images to the unwrapped lines of papyrus that we have mapped and provides a visual aid to view them side by side. It maps the x,y,z co-ordinates in the wrapped scrolls to the straightened papyrus.
-The visualisation that this tool provides allows you to scroll through multiple consecutive images.
