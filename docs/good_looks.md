Good/bad results...
----------------


You have good results when...

 * moving the cursor around on the right image makes the cross on the left move around the curve of the scroll.
 * At Z=0 on the right (the middle of a sheet), there are no dark bands or lines across the middle of the image (suggests the function is not correctly following the layers, and has skipped one!)


 At that point you want to save the flattened image (typically ~3000px x 3000px x 20px).   Thats the input to the ink detection bit, which isn't implemented here...
